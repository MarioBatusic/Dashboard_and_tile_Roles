## Issue Title:

Proposal for `dashboard` and `tile` roles

## Contents

More and more web applications use dashboards as their main access-point to its data and processes. 

I propose a role `dashboard` and its sub-role `tile` or `card` as required semantics and as the startpoint on the way to future HTML elements for these already used constructs.

See [further thoughts to this proposal](https://github.com/MarioBatusic/Dashboard_and_tile_Roles/blob/main/dashboard%20%26%20tile%20roles.md).
