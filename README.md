## Issue Name:

Proposal for `dashboard` and `tile` Roles

## Contents

More and more Web Applications use DÂ dashboards as its main access-point to its data and processes. 

I propose a role `dashboard` and its sub-role `tile` or `card` as required semantics and as the startpoint on the way to future HTML elements for these already used constructs.
